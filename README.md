### Gravo-Lan's Portfolio 📁 

Hi there! 👋 I am Gravo-Lan. I am a full-stack backend developer who likes tinkering with many programming langauges. I am currently studying in Hong Kong, and learning many different langauges such as Python, ZSH, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Typescript, and Swift. Feel free to look around my profile (even though I might not currently have much to showcase) and take inspiration from any code you find interesting (with credit!)
